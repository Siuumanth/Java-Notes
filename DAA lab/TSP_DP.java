/*
ðŸ”· What Each Variable Stores:
graph[n][n]:
The cost matrix storing the direct travel cost from city i to city j.
If no direct path, the cost is set to INF.

dp[currentCity][countVisited]:
Stores the minimum cost to complete the TSP tour from currentCity, after visiting countVisited cities.
It avoids redundant recursive calculations (memoization).

path[currentCity][countVisited]:
Stores the next city chosen from currentCity at this step in the tour.
It's used to reconstruct the final path after the computation is done.

visited[n]:
A boolean array to track which cities have been visited so far in the current recursive path.
Used for ensuring no city is visited more than once.

ðŸ”¶ How the Program Works (Summary):
The program takes a cost matrix as input and uses a recursive function tsp() to explore all valid tours starting from city 0. At each recursive call, it tries all unvisited cities as the next move, calculates the total tour cost from that point onward, and keeps track of the minimum.

To speed up repeated subproblems, it uses dp[][] to store already computed states. The best choice at each step is also recorded in path[][] to later reconstruct and print the optimal tour.
Once all recursive calls are done, the minimum cost is printed along with the full tour path from city 0 back to 0.
